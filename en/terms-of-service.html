Therefore, this implies that before you accept or agree to these Terms and Conditions, you should contact us about any part thereof that you find unfavourable, obscure, or unacceptable to you.</p><h3>  27. Our Duty towards Privacy and Security:</h3><p>  In order to promote appropriate use of information, sustain accuracy of data, and deter unauthorised access, we have established logical and suitable electronic, managerial, and physical processes, which will secure and protect all information we get from the internet. For more details, kindly read our Privacy Policy.</p><h3> 28. Assignment to Third Parties:</h3><p>  Pro Platinums has the fully right to transfer, grant, sublicense, or confer all or any of its rights included herein, which includes rights that relate to data or information, totally or partially to any third party. The implication of this is that only Pro Platinums and not the User may ascribe totally or in parts, the agreement between Pro Platinums and User based on the terms established within the Terms and Conditions.

Withdrawal Policy:</h3><p>  Any withdrawal invalidates all bonuses proportionately. For instance, with the granting of a bonus that requires a minimum trading volume, if there is a withdrawal request before meeting the necessary trading volume, the final bonus will be directly proportional to the met volume.</p><h3> 32. There is a 10000USD Maximum Deposit per credit card transaction and 250USD Minimum Deposit per credit card transaction.</h3><h3>  33. Contacting Us:</h3><p>  If you have more concerns or questions about anything, you can contact us at any time.</p><h3>  34. Marketing Promotions &amp; Bonuses</h3><p>  General Bonus Policy - In the interest of fair trading, traders must buy or sell at least 3.3 lots in real money mode for each unit of $10 bonus granted by protradefx before submitting any withdrawal requests. Each lot accounts for 100,000 currency units you choose to buy or sell. For Example: If you receive a bonus of 30$ your trading requirement is 10 lots which equals 1,000,000 currency units. Keep in mind that the number of currency units you&#39;re buying or selling per trade is determined by the amount of your trade X the leverage. So for example if you&#39;re making a trade for the amount of 250$ with a leverage of 1:400, 250x400=100,000 so you&#39;re buying or selling one lot. By accepting any bonus from protradefx you deem to accept all of the terms &amp; conditions of Bonus Policy above. In the case that a deposit bonus has been provided that exceed the 25% of the initial deposit, on request of withdrawal in case that the lots required for withdrawing the bonus allotted funds not completed the bonus and profit will be deducted from the withdrawal requested amount. All promotions, bonuses or special promotions that we offer or will offer in the future are subject to specific promotional terms and conditions. All complimentary bonus money credited to your account must be strictly used under the specific promotion&#39;s terms and conditions. At all times, we reserve the right to retract and/or cancel any such promotion, bonus or special offer. If we suspect that a user has abused or attempted to abuse a bonus and/or other promotion or otherwise acted with a lack of good faith towards us, then we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to deny, withhold or withdrawal from that user the bonus or promotion and if necessary to cancel any terms &amp; conditions with respect to that user, either temporarily or permanently, or terminate that user&#39;s access to the service and/or block that user&#39;s account. Any eligibility for a bonus will grant the bonus to be credited only once per account, person, household and/or any environment where</p><h2> REFUND AND PAYMENTS POLICY</h2><p>  The client is entitled for a full refund on his unused funds, in case the client loose there is no refunds for this funds and the company will not be held responsible. in order to receive the refund the client needs to present with a full KYC documents. after having those documents we will process the request and the company will refund the funds to the same deposit method given by the client at first within 7 days excluding transfer fees etc.</p><h2> REWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2><p> Pro Platinums offers enticing reward packages to its regular and new customers. Rewards and one-time trading points are part of Pro Platinums&rsquo;s marketing strategy. These rewards/bonuses have time limits and their conditions can change at any time. If you want to withdraw your reward, you will need to fulfil a trading volume of a minimum of 25 times for every $1 reward. You can withdraw this reward/bonus when you have fulfilled the aforementioned condition in its entirety. If you make any withdrawal from an account before meeting the conditions of reward, we will cancel such a withdrawal and debit the amount from the account. Any suspicion of cash back hedging, fraudulent activity, manipulation, or other forms of dishonest and misleading activity because of the reward offer will void the account with the redemption of any losses or profits.</p><h2> NOTE</h2><p>  You would be violating the law if you solicit any U.S. person to engage in the buying and selling of commodity options or &lsquo;prediction&rsquo; contracts. However, you can do this only if such commodities are in the list of tradable commodities and traded on a CFTC-approved exchange or otherwise legally exempt.</p>
